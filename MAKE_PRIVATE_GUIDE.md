# Make GitHub Repository Private

## Step 1: Make Repository Private

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/bondliden/lagobravo-website`
2. Click **Settings** tab (top right)
3. Scroll down to **Danger Zone** section
4. Click **Change visibility**
5. Select **Make private**
6. Type repository name to confirm
7. Click **I understand, change repository visibility**

## Step 2: Use GoDaddy Hosting (Recommended)

Since private repos can't use GitHub Pages for free, upload your complete website to GoDaddy:

### Files Ready for Upload:
Your `godaddy_upload/` folder contains:
- `index.html` - Complete Lago Bravo resort website
- `assets/` - All stylesheets, scripts, and images
- `.htaccess` - Server configuration

### GoDaddy Upload Process:
1. Login to GoDaddy hosting
2. Go to File Manager → `public_html/`
3. Delete existing files
4. Upload all files from `godaddy_upload/` folder
5. Your website is live and private

## Result

✅ **Private repository** - Code is hidden from public
✅ **Professional website** - Hosted on your GoDaddy domain  
✅ **Complete features** - Golf course, marina, real estate, accommodations
✅ **Your authentic logo** - Properly integrated throughout
✅ **No monthly fees** - One-time setup
