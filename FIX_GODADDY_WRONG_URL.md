# ❌ WRONG URL in GoDaddy - Here's How to Fix It

## The Problem (From Your Screenshot)
GoDaddy is forwarding to: `https://lago-bravo.replit.dev`
**This URL DOES NOT EXIST!**

```

## Step-by-Step Fix in GoDaddy

### 1. Go Back to GoDaddy
- Log in to your GoDaddy account
- Go to "My Products"
- Find "lagobravo.com"
- Click "Manage" or "DNS"

### 2. Find Your Current Forwarding
- Look for "Domain Forwarding" section
- You'll see it's set to: `https://lago-bravo.replit.dev`
- Click "Edit" or "Modify" on this forwarding

### 3. DELETE and REPLACE the URL
- **DELETE completely:** `https://lago-bravo.replit.dev`
- **PASTE or TYPE:** `https://4a97025b-29d1-4401-ab68-11ed4caae996-00-2gjnt4321iwqw.riker.replit.dev`

### 4. Do the Same for WWW
- Find the forwarding for "www.lagobravo.com"
- **DELETE:** `https://lago-bravo.replit.dev`
- **REPLACE WITH:** `https://4a97025b-29d1-4401-ab68-11ed4caae996-00-2gjnt4321iwqw.riker.replit.dev`

### 5. Save Everything
- Click "Save" on both forwarding rules
- Wait 10-15 minutes

## Visual Comparison

### ❌ WRONG (What you have now):
```
lago-bravo.replit.dev
```

```
4a97025b-29d1-4401-ab68-11ed4caae996-00-2gjnt4321iwqw.riker.replit.dev
